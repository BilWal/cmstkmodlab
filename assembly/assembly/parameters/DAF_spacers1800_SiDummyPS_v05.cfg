#-- Last updated on June 14th 2021 (V5 recalibrations after vacuum plate was remachined to enlarge the HV tail slot, and computed new 'ideal distances' based on CAD/GDS drawings for new sensors)

# Sensor    Ref-Point = corner of fiducial marker measured with Pattern Recognition
# Spacer    Ref-Point = corner of spacer in correspondence with the Sensor Ref-Point
# Baseplate Ref-Point = corner [...]
# NB: 'edge' <-> corner
